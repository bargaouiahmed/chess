        <h1> A brief introduction to chess</h1>
        <h2> A brief history of chess</h2>
        <p> Chess as we know it, is thought to have originated in india, both including different pieces and different rules, then it's culture is believed to have propagated to persia and china later on in history<br>
        afterwards, it is thought that the arabs changed the names of pieces to suit their religious beliefs at the time and due to trading and foreign exchange, it spread to europe and later on the americas.</p>
        <h2> Why chess</h2>
        <p> "Chess is just another board game", is what i would say if i didn't know what i'm talking about, however, chess is <strong>THE boardgame</strong>, as it experiments with almost all aspects of "Thought"<br>
        such as pattern recognition, creative thinking, memorization, and quick thinking, it also requires some psychological mastery to excel at it, among the skills required are stress management<br>
    fortitude of ego, persistence, and handling failure, chess is also more accessible nowadays than ever due to it's surge in popularity in 2020's covid lockdown with websites such ass lichess and chess.com (this isn't promition, it actually is the name of the website) </p>
    <h2> The game cycle of chess</h2>
    <ol><p> Chess is mainly composed of three phases:</p>
        <li> Opening:
            <div><p>The opening phase revolves around memorization and chess principles, in this phase both parties develop their pieces moving them from their initial squares<br>
            to achieve different goals, most commonly in the opening the battle revolves around controlling the most squares in the center of the board,

        </li>
        <li>The middlegame:
            <div>
                <p>The middlegame is where the actualy battle of minds takes place, in this phase, both parties are out of any previous known territory (unless they are grandmasters) and <br>
                are thinking independently, this phase is highly complicated so <a href="https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-middlegame" target="_blank">here is a professional explanation of it</a></p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>The endgame:
            <div>
                <p>Endgames are the dark horses of chess, most beginner and intermediate players don't give them the props they deserve, while an advanced player may lose both the opening and middlegame battles and save the game <br>
                in the endgame, this phase begins when the previous ends and it's when most pieces are already off the board, most commonly the target of endgames is promoting pawns to queens as rarely an endgame is played with checkmate as the target. <a href="https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-endgame#:~:text=The%20endgame%20in%20chess%20is,early%20checkmates%20in%20the%20opening)."> here is another professional deep dive into endgames </a></p>
